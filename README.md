## Welcome!
This is a simple repository to implement SMTP server with NodeJS.

This project is fun project built from testing and learning perspective.
For starting this project I have been interested in using some of the resources avilable in the internet.

Some of them are documentations and some of them are tutorial videos from youtube. I have included those resources here if you may be interested in them.

### Getting Started

In order to get started with this repository, you need to do the following.
- Get a clone of the project `Git Clone`
- There are four main folders in this repository: `Frontend`, `Backend`, `Mobile` and `assets`.

### Repository

- `Frontend` - Contains a react application that will be used as a method of interacting with the email received as well as to send new emails.
- `Backend` - Contains a HTTP server and a SMTP server. The HTTP server is responsible for communication with the frontend including web and mobile application to display incoming email and also to send a new email from user. The STMP server is responsible for actually receiving emails for the client, and to deliver the emails of client to other SMTP server.
- `Mobile` - Contains a Flutter based mobile application that replicates the functionality of web app in mobile platforms like android and iOS
